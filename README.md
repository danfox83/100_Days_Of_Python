# 100_Days_Of_Python
A history of python projects following a 100 days of code challenge.  

##Overview

This is a collection of python coding projects following the udemy course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp."  I began this course in late December 2021, so these projects form the history of my recent progress.  I will at first be uploading my backlog of completed projects - at the time of writing I'm somewhere in the late 60s out of the 100 "days" - and then I will use this repo for my ongoing progress.  Please feel free to browse and make any suggestions!
